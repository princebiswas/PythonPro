Inheritance - Auaring the properties from the other class - that is called a Inheritance
and we can achieve with the help of classname(parentclassName)


what is Multi level inheritance

step by step inheritance

what is multiple inheritance

if one class want to inherit more than one class at a time


can we achieve multiple inheritance in python

yes it possible at class level

what is the difference between multiple and multi level

what is single inheritance - and inheritance both is same

what is Many to one Inheritance

what is One to Many Inheritance - Multiple Inheritance - both is same -

IS-A relation - Multi level inheritance/Inheritance

HAS-A relation - Multiple Inheritance

Method Over riding - We have to apply the same method but in different class and we can achieve with the
help of inheritance and implementation should be different

Method Overloading - that will discuss later

Constructor - Constructor Name and class Name should be same - that mandatory but in Python

we will call Constructor with the help "__init__"

if user is not declaring any constructor - compiler will create default constructor

if user is creating any constructor - compiler will not create default constructor

in Python we cant create multiple constructor - because no scope of Constructor overload in python

Constructor doesnt contain any return type


Polymorphism - Same object behaving different different instance through out the execution of the
pgm that is called a polymorphism

Run Time polymorphims - Method Over ridning

Compile Time Polymorphism  --- Method Over loading /Function over loading -
